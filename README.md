# Capture the Flag


Capture the Flag is a prototype I've been working on in 2018. I'm using it to practice modeling and to test AI behavior. I've made all of the Assets so far and have written all of the code myself. I've been trying to balance making it a complete game with testing new features.


The current build does not have any animations or sound, and  it relies on default Unity UI components, but it is playable. The first two computer play styles I've been working on are direct and guard. Direct computer players will go straight for the flag and prioritize scoring. Guard computer players circle the goal to defend the flag from enemies.
